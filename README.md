# AME 520 - Understanding Activity - Meeting Unknown 

## Project Description
- This project is a video I've made about one of my characters meeting characters from my MOCAP video.

## Making It
- When making this project it required me to use stuff that was already made like my character's sprites and my recent MOCAP video. On this folder you'll see that I have uploaded both the video and the file to show you how I made it. 

## Expectations
- It was suppose to be a video showing the 2D character getting squashed at the end along with him trying to out run the five of them.
- It was going to play like a dream the character is having after getting squashed.

## What Actually Happened
- It became a simple random video about my character looking around and at the 3D characters while moving.
